BUGS AND ISSUES
---------------------------------
- Using this mod with other HUD mod simply results in glitch or crash.
- There's bug where texts are not displayed in SAMP. Using modloader or SAMP FXT Fix will solve this problem.
- Vehicle Name might crash the game if used with limit adjuster. The cause is hacked DFF limit, which mostly only used in map mods.
- Textures goes behind every other sprites on-screen. While it's not serious, still counts as bug since weapon icons even displayed behind sniper crosshair.
